Happy 40, bud! Love, Pete and Chris.

# Ok, what do I do?

1. clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/taketime/mike-decoder-ring.git`

2. run

```shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --user
python3 decode.py
```

# OR

Maybe you're having trouble with python/env setup. That's ok. Try out [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16JAiTRZwD1xCvZB_rmqfW55YDMOVOs1u) instead.
